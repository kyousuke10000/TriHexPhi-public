## 🔒 Spec Gate Features

### Validation Checks

1. **Allowed Paths**
   - Validates against `specs/architecture.yml` guardrails
   - Fails PR if files outside allowed paths

2. **Frontmatter**
   - Requires `trihex_layer` field
   - Validates required fields per type

3. **KPI Compliance**
   - Compares actual measurements vs targets
   - Proof coverage tracking

## 📋 Acceptance Criteria

| Criterion | Status |
|-----------|--------|
| Spec files created | ✅ 3 files |
| ADR template | ✅ Created |
| docs/index.md updated | ✅ Done |
| Spec Gate in CI | ✅ Integrated |
| PR violation test | ⏳ Pending |

---

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Test Spec Gate

```bash
# Create test violation
echo "test" > /tmp/violation.md

# Run validation
node scripts/spec-gate.mjs /tmp/violation.md

# Expected: FAIL (file not in allowed paths)
```

### Test PR Flow

1. Create branch with path violation
2. Push to trigger Harmonia CI
3. Verify Spec Gate fails PR
